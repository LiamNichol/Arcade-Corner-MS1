## Version Control
---

### Git & GitHub

I used **[GitPod](https://gitpod.io/)** as a local repository and IDE and **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** as a remote repository. The process of version control was:

* First i created a new repository on GitHub 
* I have then opened that repository on GitPod and started coding
* In GitPod i have created all the pages and and folders 
* I was then saving my work and pushing it to GitHub repository to keep it safe
* Process for saving, commiting and pushing it to remote repository goes as follows (done in terminal):
*   * `git add . `  for adding work to git
    * `git commit -m "Commit message" `  to commit the work on the stage
    * `git push `  to update work to GitHub

## Deployment
---

To deploy the website, I followed the below steps on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
1. Go to **"Settings"** on the repository
2. On **"Source"** of **"GitHub Pages"**, select **"master** for Branch and click save
3. The website is now published on GitHub Pages and the link is provided on on the same section
